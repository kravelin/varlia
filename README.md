# [Varlia](http://varlia.online)


Varlia.online runs on CodeIgniter. Included in this repository is the relevant modified CodeIgniter configuration files as well as the pages written by me for the site.

style.css contains my CSS files which includes some overrides to the base Bootstrap CSS which is used on the site.
map-modal.js is a small js script to create a modal for the maps page to view the maps.

Images used on the site are included in the repository as well.

It runs off of a mysql database which is not included in this repository but the DB schema file is included.

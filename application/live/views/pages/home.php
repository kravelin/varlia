                <p id="header-content">The world of Varlia is a custom campaign world for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition RPG (Role-Playing Game). Found here are the details of the world's places,
                   important people (NPCs), gods, history and lore, races, classes, monsters, and magic (spells and items). There are game rules here when needed but I won't repeat the rules already
                   published by Wizards of the Coast in their official products and instead only have rules for my custom content. Varlia is an old world just coming out of the dark ages of a massive
                   war that raged across reality and levelled many ancient empires. Now the races are again exploring their world and finding ancient ruins and battlefields. War beasts still roam the
                   wilds of the world making it a dangerous place. The gods are turning their attention to the races of the world again as well as their explorations stir up old holy sites and slivers
                   of divine power left behind from the Forsaken War.</p>
